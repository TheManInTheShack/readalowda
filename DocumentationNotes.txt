    Looking to help him with BeautifulSoup and web scraping. So far ive been able to scrape text from the URL page hes been trying to open. (i.e HTML -> text file)

    Updated:

        - function chapter_links_creator - grabs the links of each chapter and puts a "link_i and text_i" key into a dictionary which gets put into an array into the the original dictionary (yes its confusing idk)
        - function textfromchapter - grabs the link and scrapes just the specific texts we want
        - I placed dictionary/object in a text file "levianthanTOC.txt" take a peak - PS it keeps the indentation when you call the specific text

    Problem: 

        1. We inevitably have to run through 57 chapters = 57 links which takes up some compile time and makes this app more of a 1 time type of process.
        2. Some code maybe still premature and could be more dynamic.
        3. I worked on creating the data structure with what i had in mind. Slightly off to what you want i believe
